# Solvatten App Data

## Introduction

This repo contains the data necessary for the Solvatten mobile application.

`languages.json` contains the available languages for the users with their respective iso code.

Each language available has an aasociated file containing all the content and traductions available for it.  

For example: English has `en.json`, Spanish has `es.json`, Swahili has `sw.json` etc.

## Syncing

In order to make data syncing easier for the editor, data is pushed directly to this repo from the Content Management System (CMS).

There is then no need to update the files in this repo directly, use instead the CMS and the dashboard created for that purpose.

## Contributing

The app is only available for the languages contained in this repo, if you wish to contribute and make it available for other languages, feel free to reach Solvatten via email.
